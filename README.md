# Autonomous Car Navigation in India: Overcoming the Challenges with Computer Vision and Deep Learning

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our final year project, which aims to revolutionize autonomous driving in challenging environments like those in India. This project is dedicated to addressing the unique obstacles that have hindered the widespread adoption of self-driving cars in regions with minimal lane markings, extensive traffic, and rough road conditions.

## Project Vision

Our mission is to leverage the power of computer vision and deep learning to develop an autonomous driving system capable of navigating through complex and unpredictable environments. By focusing on virtual pathfinding and speed algorithms, we aim to create a robust solution that can:

- **Accurately detect and avoid potholes.**
- **Identify and follow virtual paths in the absence of lane markings.**
- **Navigate through heavy and dynamic traffic.**

## Approach

Given the complexities of the Indian road conditions, traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) might not be sufficient. We are exploring alternative neural network architectures that can be custom-designed to handle these challenges more effectively. Our approach includes:

1. **Learning and Utilizing Python Libraries:**
   - **Deep Learning:** Leveraging libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
   - **Computer Vision:** Utilizing OpenCV for real-time image processing and object detection.

2. **Neural Network Design:**
   - Studying and implementing neural networks from scratch to understand and customize hidden layers for optimal performance.

## Current Focus

Our initial focus is on developing and refining virtual pathfinding and speed algorithms. This involves:

- **Training Models:** Using existing datasets and creating custom datasets to train models for obstacle avoidance and pathfinding.
- **Algorithm Development:** Implementing and testing various algorithms to determine the most effective solutions for real-time navigation.

## Future Work

While our current work is primarily in the virtual and simulation stages, we aim to eventually transition to real-world testing and implementation. This will involve:

- **Field Testing:** Deploying our models on prototype vehicles for real-world testing.
- **Iterative Improvement:** Continuously refining our algorithms based on field test results and feedback.

Join us on this exciting journey as we push the boundaries of autonomous driving and pave the way for safer and more efficient transportation in challenging environments.
